## Simulation of an ecosystem on a toroidal lattice with three species

We study a modification of a well-known dynamic cell process, aiming to mimic the predator-prey interaction in Biology. It is introduced by Alexander Dewdney in 1984 for two “species” on a toroidal lattice, with straightforward procedures for procreation, starvation and death and is observed to have features reasonably similar to both the Lotka-Volterra model and actual predator-prey observation data. Its most important feature is that with suitable initial conditions it stays in balance indefinitely, exhibiting cyclic behaviour.
